# üìù ThinkBoard - A MERN Stack Notes App

**ThinkBoard** is a full-featured, full-stack notes application built with the **MERN Stack**: **MongoDB**, **Express**, **React**, and **Node.js**. It offers a modern, responsive UI and a RESTful backend with real-world enhancements like **rate limiting** to simulate production-ready systems.

## HIGHLIGHTS

- **Full-Stack CRUD Functionality**  
  Create, edit, update, and delete notes with a title and content field.

- **Built with the MERN Stack**  
  - **MongoDB** ‚Äì NoSQL database to store notes
  - **Express.js** ‚Äì Web framework to build a RESTful API
  - **React.js** ‚Äì Frontend interface with seamless UX
  - **Node.js** ‚Äì Backend runtime environment

- **Fully Functional REST API**  
  With clear route structure and tested HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.

- **Rate Limiting with Upstash Redis**  
  Implemented simple and effective rate limiting using serverless Redis ‚Äî a real-world production pattern to prevent abuse.

- **Responsive UI**  
  Designed with **Tailwind CSS** and **DaisyUI** for a mobile-first, accessible interface that works beautifully across all devices.

- **Core Web Concepts**  
  Practical usage and demonstration of:
  - HTTP methods and status codes
  - SQL vs NoSQL (and why MongoDB was chosen)
  - Frontend-backend connection via Axios

# MongoDB URI
MONGO_URI=<your_mongo_uri>

# Upstash Redis (for rate limiting)
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=<your_redis_rest_url>
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=<your_redis_rest_token>

NODE_ENV=development
```

3. Run the backend:
